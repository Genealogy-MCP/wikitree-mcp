# Security Policy

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 2.0.x   | Yes       |
| < 2.0   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Use [GitLab confidential issues](https://gitlab.com/genealogy-mcp/wikitree-mcp/-/issues/new?confidential=true)
to report any vulnerability confidentially.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement:** within 7 days of submission.
- **Coordinated disclosure window:** 90 days from acknowledgement. We will work with
  you to develop and release a fix before any public disclosure.
- **If accepted:** a patched release will be published and you will be credited in the
  changelog (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
- **If declined:** you will receive a clear explanation of why the report does not
  qualify as a security vulnerability in this project.

### Scope

This server runs locally and queries the public WikiTree API over HTTPS. All tools are
read-only — no write operations exist and no authentication credentials are stored.
Reports relevant to injection vulnerabilities in tool inputs, data leakage in MCP
responses (e.g. internal state or unexpected API data), response parsing issues,
denial-of-service via crafted parameters, or SSRF if the API base URL is overridden
are in scope.
